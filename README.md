testing for possible GIS front-end


Uses Google Maps API

To use, please supply your own API key from google.
You can go here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map?authuser=1
and then login to your account and click "get a key" to get an API key. The api key goes in the script api callback link in the html file.

To run just open the html file after cloning this repo.

This is just to demonstrate the use of Polyline. It also attempts to request details about a place using a Place ID, in order to grab location.
The latter part is currently a work in progress.
